Usage:
------

	deployShell will only execute as a 'deploy' user on a deploy server.
	The shell is intended to provide SSH-based command-interaction with
	a point of deployment for one or more cloud-providers.

	Currently only DigitalOcean is supported.

	To interact with deployShell simply execute--

		ssh user@fqdn.tld 'command [arg1 [arg{2...6}]]'


Example:
--------
		
	ssh deploy@git.samcaldwell.net 'help'

Built-in Commands:
------------------

	'help' 			-> shows this screen
	'docs' 			-> displays the documentation screen
	'copyright' 	-> displays the copyright screen
	'license' 		-> shows the software license notice
	'environment' 	-> shows deploy environment variables
	'update'		-> updates the deployShell from source.
	'listCommands'	-> list the current add-on commands in
					   the bin/ directory.
	
	
Add-on Commands:
----------------

	The system supports 'add-on commands' which are external scripts
	contained in the deployShell/bin/ directory.  These scripts can
	be listed using the 'listCommands' built-in command:
	
		ssh user@fqdn.tld 'listCommands'
		
	Any add-on command should support the following call--
		
		ssh user@fqdn.tld 'command help'
		
	and display its context-specific help file.	


Command: createServer:
----------------------
ssh deploy@git.samcaldwell.net 'createServer myAcct myRecipe'
